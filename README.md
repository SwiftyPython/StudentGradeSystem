# StudentGradeSystem
Student Grade Records


The student grading system uses the power of iostream's file stream and impliments it in such a way that it allows for CRUD to be applied to the text file.

Due to this you can add to the text file by appending it to the end and edit a line by Student Number as the selction you can also delete the whole line via a student number as well as selection.

Lines or better yet a entry is composssed of 4 things:

1) Student Number (identifier)
2) Student Name
3) Student Grade
4) Additional Comment for student


The code uses a lot of string manipulation as well as iostreams file stream and inputs.

There is no Graphical user interface (GUI).
